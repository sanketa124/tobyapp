Due to the lack of technological and financial resources by small oil companies, large oil companies took over the exploration of commercial oil in the country. Thereafter, licenses were given to D'Arcy Exploration Company and Whitehall Petroleum but neither company found oil of commercial value and they returned their licenses in 1923. A new license covering was given to Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a consortium of Shell and British Petroleum (then known as Anglo-Iranian). The company began exploratory work in 1937. The consortium was granted license to explore oil all over the territory of Nigeria but the acreage allotted to the company in the original license was reduced in 1951 and then between 1955 and 1957. Drilling activities started in 1951 with the first test well drilled in Owerri area. Oil was discovered in non-commercial quantities at Akata, near Eket in 1953. Prior to the Akata find, the company had spent around 6 million pounds on exploratory activities in the country. Shell-BP in the pursuit of commercially available petroleum found oil in Oloibiri, Nigeria in 1956. Other important oil wells discovered during the period were Afam and Bomu in Ogoni territory. Production of crude oil began in 1957 and in 1960, a total of 847,000 tonnes of crude oil was exported. Towards the end of the 1950s, non-British firms were granted license to explore for oil: Mobil in 1955, Tenneco in 1960, Gulf Oil and later Chevron in 1961, Agip in 1962, and Elf in 1962. Prior to the discovery of oil, Nigeria (like many other African countries) strongly relied on agricultural exports to other countries to supply their economy. Many Nigerians thought the developers were looking for palm oil. But after nearly 50 years searching for oil in the country, Shell-BP discovered the oil at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta.

The mantle is divided into upper and lower mantle, which are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the mantle next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D\u2033 (pronounced dee-double-prime) layer. The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is \u2248140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid, the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the lower part of the mantle flows less easily than does the upper mantle (chemical changes within the mantle may also be important). The viscosity of the mantle ranges between 10 and 10 Pa\u00b7s, depending on depth. In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10 Pa\u00b7s and that of pitch is 10 Pa\u00b7s.

Laila, a university student, is bought to her sorority home by Ozzie Jones, which sees actor Mark Holton reprising his role, and Tory is revealed to be Laila's mother who has died of cancer, having lived much of her life fearing the creature's return. After dropping Laila off at the house - the same house from 1993, now branded with the AU sorority symbol - he drops his phone while unloading her luggage, and upon returning to retrieve it, he is spat on from down the well by a splash of green water, some of which he swallows, and during his getaway he begins experiencing stomach pains, leading to the creature rebirthing himself and escaping. He kills Ozzie by tearing out of his torso before appearing at the house, killing two of Laila's sorority sisters and the two men. He is eventually electrocuted and ignited, causing the house to explode, but after Laila and Katie (Pepi Sonuga) escape and are driven back to the university campus, he is revealed to have reanimated and is last shown flagging down a truck for a drive to Bismarck, the capital of North Dakota."]

Club\", wrote that \"things become sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew into a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick does not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a growing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea of walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that this decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of murder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group and forced his own son to put down his mother\". \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Laura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open the lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you consider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with vendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of\" Slant Magazine\" described the episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a conspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of disconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene ends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a foreboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden strike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how the episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in the show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode \"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking lengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it helps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first place. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who probably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the gate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that when Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar shoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers that Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in the series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I loved the way Andrew went out! He went out like a G, and he took a few people with him! [...] Die Hard \"TWD\" fans will remember my character forever because of all the trouble he caused. Plus Andrew almost got Rick!

This removes the constraint on the physical size of the embryonic mass and exposes the outer cells of the blastocyst to the interior of the uterus. Furthermore, hormonal changes in the mother, specifically a peak in luteinizing hormone (LH), prepare the endometrium to receive and envelop the blastocyst. The immune system is also modulated to allow for the invasion of the foreign embryonic cells. Once bound to the extracellular matrix of the endometrium, trophoblast cells secrete enzymes and other factors to embed the blastocyst into the uterine wall.

A transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a DNA binding site called a promoter region before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides."]

The first helicopter model to carry a pilot was in 1907. Two French brothers, Jacques and Louis Breguet, built the \"Gyroplane No.1\" sometime between 14 August and 29 September 1907. It lifted its pilot 2 ft into the air for about a minute. The Gyroplane No.1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of the airframe to hold it steady. On 13 November 1907, another French inventor, Paul Cornu, designed and built the Cornu helicopter. It lifted its inventor off the ground and remained aloft for 20 seconds. Even though this flight did not surpass in height the flight of the Gyroplane No. 1, it was reported to be the first truly free flight with a pilot as it did not need to be held steady. Almost three decades later, German aviation pioneer and co-founder of the Focke-Wulf company, invented the Fw 61. This was the world's first practical transverse twin-rotor helicopter. It first flew on 26 June 1936 to more than 8,000 feet (2,400 m) at speeds of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). A few years later, on 11 December 1951, turbine engines started being used in helicopters. This meant the helicopter could fly with a large amount of power and a low weight penalty.", "Ragtime was also a modification of the march style popularized by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. Ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\"ca.\" 1868\u20131917) became famous through the publication of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \"The Entertainer\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \"Maple Leaf Rag\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, chord progressions or metric patterns."]

In a single day, about 40,000 soldiers on both sides died or were left wounded on the field. Henry Dunant was shocked by the terrible aftermath of the battle, the suffering of the wounded soldiers, and the near-total lack of medical attendance and basic care. He completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded. He succeeded in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance by motivating the local population to aid without discrimination. Back in his home in Geneva, he decided to write a book entitled \"A Memory of Solferino\" which he published with his own money in 1862. He sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe. In addition to penning a vivid description of his experiences in Solferino in 1859, he explicitly advocated the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war. In addition, he called for the development of international treaties to guarantee the neutrality and protection of those wounded on the battlefield as well as medics and field hospitals."]

Dan initially dislikes Mark as well; Mark's choice to ride a British Triumph motorcycle rather than an American Harley-Davidson causes particular tension. However, Dan soon respects Mark's work ethic and hires him as a mechanic, both at his bike shop and his truck-inspection office. Mark's personality changes drastically over the course of the series \u2014 he starts off as a rebellious delinquent but ultimately proves himself to be a caring and responsible (though comedically dull-witted) husband and brother. Roseanne and the rest of the family eventually grow to love Mark, though they still get amusement out of insulting him. Mark has a younger brother, David, who dates (and later marries) Darlene. He also has two much younger sisters, Lisa and Nikki, who appear briefly in the Season 5 episode \"No Place Like Home for The Holidays\"."]

President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west\u2014and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg\u2014after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener\u2014concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. However, rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities. Upon receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty. The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline.

However it also maintained good relations with France and Russia. The other countries understood this duality, and did not expect Italy to join in the war in 1914. Its treaty obligations did not require it to join with Germany and Austria, and it saw very little to gain from doing so. Public opinion wanted peace, and the leadership in Rome realized how poorly prepared the nation was in contrast to the powerhouses at war. By late 1914, however, Prime Minister Antonio Salandra and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino decided that major territorial gains were possible by joining the Allies, and would help calm extremely serious internal dissension, by bringing glory to the victorious army, as well as satisfying popular feeling by freeing Italian-speaking territories from Austrian rule. There were also new patronage opportunities and political victories for the politicians. They planned to argue, plausibly, that these results would be the triumph it climax of \"Risorgimento\" (that is, Italian unification). In December 1914 Sonnino opened negotiations in Vienna, asking for territorial compensation in return for remaining neutral. These talks were designed to conceal the government's true intentions from the Italian public opinion, and from the countries at war. In March 1915 Sonnino began serious negotiations with London and France. They had an exaggerated opinion of what Italy could contribute, not realizing it would be a very expensive drain on Allied money, manpower and munitions. The Treaty of London was signed on 26 April 1915 and Italy declared war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915.

Spatial recruitment is the activation of more motor units to produce a greater force. Larger motor units contract along with small motor units until all muscle fibers in a single muscle are activated, thus producing the maximum muscle force. Temporal motor unit recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the motor unit fibres from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches \"fuse\" temporally. This produces a greater force than singular contractions by decreasing the interval between stimulations to produce a larger force with the same number of motor units."]

However it also maintained good relations with France and Russia. The other countries understood this duality, and did not expect Italy to join in the war in 1914. Its treaty obligations did not require it to join with Germany and Austria, and it saw very little to gain from doing so. Public opinion wanted peace, and the leadership in Rome realized how poorly prepared the nation was in contrast to the powerhouses at war. By late 1914, however, Prime Minister Antonio Salandra and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino decided that major territorial gains were possible by joining the Allies, and would help calm extremely serious internal dissension, by bringing glory to the victorious army, as well as satisfying popular feeling by freeing Italian-speaking territories from Austrian rule. There were also new patronage opportunities and political victories for the politicians. They planned to argue, plausibly, that these results would be the triumph it climax of \"Risorgimento\" (that is, Italian unification). In December 1914 Sonnino opened negotiations in Vienna, asking for territorial compensation in return for remaining neutral. These talks were designed to conceal the government's true intentions from the Italian public opinion, and from the countries at war. In March 1915 Sonnino began serious negotiations with London and France. They had an exaggerated opinion of what Italy could contribute, not realizing it would be a very expensive drain on Allied money, manpower and munitions. The Treaty of London was signed on 26 April 1915 and Italy declared war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. Salandra boasted that the Pact of London was \"the greatest, if not the first completely spontaneous act of foreign policy executed by Italy since the Risorgimento.\""]

Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin).

Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u2013V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80\u00a0km farther upstream compared to Mt.

An action potential is a change in voltage (membrane potential) across the membrane of the cell, produced by the movement of charged atoms (ions). Non-pacemaker cells (including the ventricular and atrial cells) have a period, immediately after an action potential, where the membrane potential remains relatively constant; this is known as a resting membrane potential. This resting phase (see cardiac action potential, phase 4) ends when another action potential reaches the cell. This produces a positive change in membrane potential (known as depolarisation), which initiates the start of the next action potential. Pacemaker cells, however, don\u2019t have this resting phase. Instead, immediately after one action potential, the membrane potential of these cells begins to depolarise again automatically, this is known as the pacemaker potential. Once the pacemaker potential reaches a set value, known as the threshold value, it then produces an action potential. Other cells within the heart (including the purkinje fibers and atrioventricular node; AVN) can also initiate action potentials; however, they do so at a slower rate and therefore, if the SA node is working, it usually beats the AVN to it."]
